# 💫 About Me:
🔭 I’m currently working on developing my skills as a research coder by completing several courses on python and beginning my C++ journey.  <br>👯 I’m looking to collaborate on physics laboratory experiments, possibly involving some type of GPU programing. <br>🤝 I’m looking for help with developing as a coder and more importantly as a learner. I continuously seek for internship associated work in my areas of curiosity involving, Condensed Matter theory, QFT and Density Functional Theory.  <br>🌱 I’m currently learning on becoming more fluent in python and learning other computational languages that could be used in an physic experimental/laboratory circumstance. <br>💬 I am a third year Theoretical Physics BA student at Trinity College Dublin that is about to begin his journey in the realm of computational investigations with focus on physic related issues. <br>⚡ Fun Fact I have always leaved internationally, moving a total of 10 times throughout my parents carriers.
